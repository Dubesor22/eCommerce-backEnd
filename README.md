<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

## Create tables from console:

```
// COMMANDS ON CONSOLE TO CREATE MODELS

sequelize model:generate --name User --attributes username:string,firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string,password:string,role:enum,birthDate:date,gender:enum,active:boolean

sequelize model:generate --name Category --attributes name:string

sequelize model:generate --name Product --attributes name:string,price:float,description:string,CategoryId:integer,active:boolean

sequelize model:generate --name Order --attributes date:date,status:enum,UserId:integer

sequelize model:generate --name Detail --attributes OrderId:integer,ProductId:integer,quantity:integer,price:float

sequelize model:generate --name Review --attributes UserID:integer,ProductId:integer,content:string,starts:integer,active:boolean
```

Manually add the ENUM values:

```js
// Users
role: DataTypes.ENUM('user', 'premium', 'seller', 'manager', 'admin'),
gender: DataTypes.ENUM("M", "F"),

// Orders
status: DataTypes.ENUM("open", "paid", "sent", "delivered", "cancelled"),


```

After the creation of models, add associations in the `models` folder:

```js
User.hasMany(models.Order);
User.belongsToMany(models.Product, { through: models.Review });

Category.hasMany(models.Product);

Product.belongsTo(models.Category);
Product.belongsToMany(models.Order, { through: models.Detail });

Order.belongsTo(models.User);
Order.belongsToMany(models.Product, { through: models.Detail });
Order.belongsToMany(models.User, { through: models.Review });

Detail.belongsTo(models.Order);
Detail.belongsTo(models.Product);
```

```
sequelize db:drop
sequelize db:create
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:seed:all
```
